Divine fucking intellect.  
The idea was to make an [RPG engine in Javascript](https://github.com/wap-industries/big-dick-engine) from scratch, and I decided to remake the Shrek Dating sim as proof of concept.  
Note that in addition to all the engine GUI and shit, I made a FUCKING INTERPRETED LANGUAGE from scratch just to get the engine to work.
